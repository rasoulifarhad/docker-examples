Docker Compose scripts for Kafka


- Kafka Cluster


Runs a multi-node Kafka cluster w/ 3 brokers available at locahost:9091,localhost:9092,localhost:9093.

To start the brokers run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml up

To stop the brokers run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml down

- Control Center UI



Runs a Confluent Control Center that exposes a UI at http://locahost:9021.
Note
	The scripts must be chained together as the UI depends on the brokers

To start the brokers and the Control Center UI run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml up

To stop the brokers and the Control Center UI run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml down


- Schema Registry



Runs a Confluent Schema Registry available at http://locahost:8081.
Note
	The scripts must be chained together as the schema registry depends on the brokers

To start the brokers and the schema registry run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml up

To stop the brokers and the schema registry run the following command:

docker-compose -f ./kafka-cluster.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml down


- All The Things



The scripts can be chained together to start the cluster, UI and schema registry with the following commmand:

docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml up

Likewise, to stop all the things:

docker-compose -f kafka-cluster.yml -f ./control-center-ui.yml -f ./schema-registry.yml down

Tip
	The only "UI" representation of the schema registry is by navigating to a Topic and then clicking the Schema tab for the topic
